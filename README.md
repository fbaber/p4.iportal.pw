Project 4

In the root of your P4 app, include a file called README.md and include the following:

    1-2 paragraph description of your application
    A bulleted list of features your application includes
    What aspects of your application are being managed by JavaScript
    Any additional information the graders may need to know about using your app (for example, if certain features can only be seen by an admin, provide test admin credentials)
