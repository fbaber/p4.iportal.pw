Project 4

Project Description: 

This is a simple application that users can use to exchange currencies, users have a list of 8 options of currnices to exchange money from to the same list of 8 options of currencies (This application can support all world currencies, but in the interest of time and to be able to do full testing - I limited the options to eight currencies that include top 5 major world currencies). 

This project uses Core PHP Framework, MySQL database and JavaScript for user input validation. In project 4 i also worked on addressing some issues that were reported in P2, basically in P2 I was not able to embed the project framework in any theme; with this project i have a decent theme for the site that is responsive. 

Project Features: 

- Real time currency exchange rates are used to exchange currencies using Yahoo web-service.  
- Project 4 users curl functionality of Core PHP framework, that was covered in class 12. The source currency and target currncy selected by the user on the form is sent to the yahoo service to find out the exchange rate for the two currncies, the exhcnage rate is used in c_currnecy controller to do the currency conversion. The output is displayed on a view along with timestamp  
- Users can view history of their transactions on "Your Currency Exchange History" page - where all exchange transactions are displayed along with the timestamp of the transaction. 
- When users sign up on the website they are sent a welcome email.
